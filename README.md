Matches Student to Research Labs 

This application provides a platform to seamlessly connect users to various research laboratories based on their interests and expertise. It uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to match user profiles to the most relevant labs.

Key Features:
Diverse Laboratory Profiles: Offers descriptions and names for various research labs ranging from genetic engineering to cosmogenesis.
User Profile Matching: Uses machine learning to match user inputs, such as courses taken and research interests, to the most appropriate labs.

Prerequisites:
Please install the libraries indicated in requirements.txt

Getting Started:
Set Up Environment Variables:
First, create a .env file in your project directory and set up necessary environment variables. This project uses dotenv to load these variables.

Run the Application:
Navigate to the directory containing the application script and run:

bash
